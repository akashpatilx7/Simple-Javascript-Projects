    <!-- Flow Of The Project (Algorithm Of Copy To Clipboard)

  1. Select some text from any available document to copy to clipboard.

  2. Call a function (created in Javascript) to copy that text.

  3. Here, the copying of the selected text is done only after a programmer presses CTRL + C Virtually. We are only implementing the logic behind the Copy To Clipboard Functionality. So, to do that, we can use an input field as tool to select & copy that particular text which we want to copy. -->

    <div class="container">
      <h2 id="title">Copy To Clipboard</h2>
      <!-- Here, in the above h2, we can also use style="user-select: all" to implement the functionality of selecting all the text by just one click. (Used by GOOGLE CHROME BROWSER) -->

      <input size="75" id="myInp" type="text" />
      <!-- Here, by using the input field, we are automating the selecting and automating the copying at the same time. The "INPUT SELECTION METHOD" is easy to understand and use than the STYLE="USER-SELECT: ALL" METHOD -->

      <button id="btnCopy">Copy</button>
      <!-- When the "Copy" button is pressed, we are going to run a Javascript function that will copy all the text written in the input box and then copy the same text to the users/ clients clipboard. -->
